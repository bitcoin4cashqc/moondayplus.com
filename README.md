MoonDayPlus (MD+) will allow you to benefit as much as possible from an enriching participatory environment.



MoonDay Plus announces that before the end of the IMO, the Reward Pool contract will be active.

This pool will allow you to receive 25% of base reward. It will be possible to increase the rewards by holding NFTs and DAO tokens to reach a maximum of 75% reward.
The NFTs cannot be burned, nor exchanged for moons directly but exchangeable on Open Ocean.

They will be endowed with power and energy properties and will constitute a limited supply.

The DAO tokens can be burned to submit a voting proposal or to vote. If held the token will allow to have more reward in the reward pool.

Decision making via DAO will allow changes in all those values and restrictions.

Power to the code - power to the people.

MD + dev team.


A 1% fee will be burned for each transaction.

The games are open.
May your strategy lead you to victory!
